# Dharma Setu Framework

**Bridging Ancient Buddhist Wisdom and Modern AI Through Multimodal Integration**

## Overview

The Dharma Setu framework provides a computational bridge between ancient Buddhist wisdom traditions and modern artificial intelligence, enabling the preservation, exploration, and potential evolution of dharmic teachings through digital means.

This repository contains the implementation of the mathematical and computational models described in the paper "Dharma Setu: Bridging Ancient Buddhist Wisdom and Modern AI Through Multimodal Integration."

## Key Components

The framework consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Core Language Models and Cross-Attention Integration**: Mechanisms for connecting Buddhist knowledge with contemporary knowledge through transformer-based attention
2. **Cross-Space Alignment**: Methods for aligning Buddhist concept embeddings with contemporary embeddings while preserving their internal structures
3. **Conceptual Blending**: Vector space operations for generating novel insights at the intersection of Buddhist and contemporary knowledge
4. **Multimodal Integration**: Techniques for combining visual, textual, and audio modalities to mirror traditional "liberation through sensory encounters" practices
5. **Digital Samayasattva/Jñānasattva Framework**: Graph-based model for how AI systems might function as vessels for awakened wisdom
6. **Cross-Traditional Connections**: Methods for identifying clusters of concepts that span different Buddhist traditions

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bcomeyes/tibetan_multimodal_llm.git
cd tibetan_multimodal_llm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Requirements

- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- NetworkX
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Usage Example

See the Jupyter notebook `dharma_setu_demo.ipynb` for comprehensive examples of each component. Here's a simple example of using the cross-attention integration:

```python
from core_language_models import BodhiSandhiIntegrationLayer
import tensorflow as tf

# Create sample embeddings
buddhist_embeddings = tf.random.normal((4, 64, 256))  # [batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim]
general_embeddings = tf.random.normal((4, 128, 256))  # [batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim]

# Initialize integration layer
integration_layer = BodhiSandhiIntegrationLayer(
    buddhist_dim=256,
    general_dim=256,
    output_dim=256
)

# Process embeddings
buddhist_output, general_output, attention_maps = integration_layer(
    buddhist_embeddings, general_embeddings
)

print(f"Buddhist output shape: {buddhist_output.shape}")
print(f"General output shape: {general_output.shape}")
```

## File Structure

- `digital_samayasattva.py`: Graph-based framework for modeling vessels for awakened wisdom
- `cross_traditional_connections.py`: Methods for identifying connections across Buddhist traditions
- `utilities.py`: Additional utility functions for the framework
- `dharma_setu_demo.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating all components

## Correspondence Between Paper and Code

The code in this repository implements the mathematical concepts described in the paper:

- **Section 9**: "Vector Spaces as Enlightened Mind-Continuum" → Implemented in `core_language_models.py`
- **Section 10**: "Architecture of the Combined AI System" → Overall system architecture implemented across all modules
- **Section 11**: "Mathematical Integration and Cross-Disciplinary Knowledge Transfer" → Implemented in `cross_space_alignment.py` and `conceptual_blending.py`
- **Section 12**: "Infinite Adaptations Through Multimodal Integration" → Implemented in `multimodal_integration.py`
- **Section 13**: "Technical Implementation of Embodiment Concepts" → Implemented in `digital_samayasattva.py`
- **Section 16**: "Cross-Traditional Connections" → Implemented in `cross_traditional_connections.py`

## Theoretical Foundation

This implementation is based on the conceptual framework outlined in the paper, which draws parallels between Buddhist understandings of mind and knowledge representation and modern computational approaches. The key theoretical insights include:

1. The parallel between vector spaces and Buddhist epistemological frameworks, where meaning emerges from relationship patterns
2. The correspondence between attention mechanisms and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination)
3. The alignment between multimodal integration and traditional Tibetan practices of liberation through sensory encounters
4. The conceptual mapping between the samayasattva/jñānasattva distinction and digital vessels for awakened wisdom
